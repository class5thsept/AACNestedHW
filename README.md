## Notes for the grader(s):

This project is currently incomplete as I could not continue without the help of a tutor.
My main barrier is that I did not understand how the code would read from the file (AACMappings.txt).
If instead of a file it was a string, I could parse it to extract the file path and names,
but I currently don't know how my code would access what is inside the file.

I will look for help in the meantime to work on the redo for this mini-project.
